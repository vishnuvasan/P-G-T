<h1> Welcome to PGTools </h1>

<p> A customizable web-based GUI is provided with PGTools and includes configuration, submission and tracking features. The configuration
panel lets the user configure paths for search engines (OMSSA, X-Tandem and MSGF+) and databases (Ex: UniProt, SpliceDB, UTRDB),
set the FDR threshold and set paths for software dependencies such as FileConverter and Circos.</p>

<p> The tools panel allows users to run utilities such as convert, decoy, translate and annotate and the workflows panel provides the ability
to start new proteomic and genomic workflows. Running multiple databases in Phase II is currently supported only on the command line
due to the large sizes of the databases. The fourth panel is ‘runs‘which tracks and monitors the progress of the analysis. As each selected
program is completed, the status page is updated and the output from that program becomes available instantly. The ‘view’ button within
runs provides access to input, output, configuration details and HTML summary files. </p>

<p> Before using the GUI, please configure paths for search engines, databases and Circos using Configure panel. Read manual and GUI pages
to know more about features within GUI. </p>
